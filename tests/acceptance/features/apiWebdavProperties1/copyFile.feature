Feature: copy file
  As a user
  I want to be able to copy files
  So that I can manage my files

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And auto-accept shares has been disabled
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 1" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
